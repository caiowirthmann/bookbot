# bookbot
## this is a project by boot.dev done in python + shell (using windows powershell)

This project is finished. Main function prints a report of the Frankenstein book, with total word count and descending count of character (words only)
For further study --> Add a cout of word itself and try this project on different public domain books
Maybe even think of a method to allow the user to select the book (as long as its a .txt file) that he wants to analyze
